On confirming input, the window has to call second project's that generates the vector of random double numbers within the set range, displays the vector and copies data to clipborad. The window of the third project is called then, copying data from clipboard, sorting vector and displaying the result. The program must work correctly, if the windows of projects 2 and 3 have been opened before the one of the project 1. If the main window is closed, the windows of projects 2 and 3 must close too.
