# Lab4
Laboratory work #4, OOP

## Task
Enchance graphic editor from previous laboratory work:

* Add two new firgures using multiple inheritance: cube and line with two ellipses at each end. Add buttons with notifications to the toolbar for new figures
* Remake Class Editor hierarchy so that it has no classes that inherit from it. Make it so that Class Shape is responsible for drawing rubber trace and Editor is just a manager class that processes all the messages
